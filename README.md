# CAD-Models
A collection of my CAD models, simulation results, prototype images, and supporting documentation. This repository serves as a workspace for design exploration and prototyping progress. The goal of this repository is to document and share the evolution of designs from concept to prototype, while keeping all related resources organized in one place.
